# IOSRunningCompaninion
This app was originally written for the UCSC HACKATHON in objective C,
however we transitioned to swift mid project, that is why the (TF) files and the Bridge file are commented out, 
as they are no longer needed for the app to run. 


This app can be turned to running mode, which will track your speed and distance ran. When running mode is switched off, you will be presented with your average speed in MPH, and your average distance ran.
